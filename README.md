Dear GitHub Repo Viewer,

Hello! Thank you for stopping by my experiment, here! :smile:

This is a markdown scrum framework. Traditional scrum uses the high technology of post-it notes an a wall. On GitHub, markdown docs and a repo are about as close as you come to that. Yes, you can use trello or pivotal tracker or jira, but you can do it with post-it notes and a wall better in my estimation.

In this case, I'm using it to develop myself as a developer who scrums. 

Meta? Yes.

for weekly goals: check out the Sprint Goal  
for previous work accompished: check out Reviews and Product Increment

the rest is the foundation and rules I try to adhere to.

__For new Scrummers:__

Please feel free to ask any questions! The world of scrum and agile might seem intimidating. It is likely a very different work mindset than you're used to. But it is also a much friendlier and more productive work mindset, and one I'd very much encourage you to wrap your head around. 

Here's a quick blog post explaining <a href="http://developingian.com/scrum-explained-in-300-seconds-or-less/">Scrum in 300 seconds or less</a>.

It is not a language. It is not a toolset. It is a simple framework on which we can hang toolsets to make them neat, tidy, low mantainence, more productive and genrally happy. 

Trello is cool. Jira is cool, but all you need is your brain, post-it notes and a wall to scrum. The tool can be useful, but...

_"A fool with a tool is still a fool"_ 

The tool without the scrum mindset is not scrum. The scrum mindset requires trust. That trust allows for the scrum values to exist in a team: Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage, and Commitment. Scrum does not generate these directly, but allows them to develop through its framework and those who facilitate it. It is what a healthy scrum team imbodies while they produce a high value and timely product.

If you like the idea of being in a team that trusts and supports eachother,
where there is foucs and commitment to the goal of a valuable and relevant product,
where there is openness and respect for eachother's role in that process,
where work is done right and on time without the need for a lot of late nights,
then scrum is something that might be of interest to you.

Dear GitHub Repo Viewer,

Hello! Thank you for stopping by my experiment, here! :smile:

Allow me to introduce myself: I am Ian Carroll, and I am bootstrapping myself for a career change into sofware development. I am learning web development: JavaScript, Python, Android, and a sundry related items. I am also a Certified ScrumMaster, and have a keen interest in agile practices.

As a way of understanding scrum, "getting it into my bones", as my Theatre Professors might have said, I have decided to *go scrum myself*. That is, I am using scrum as the framework for developing myself and conducting my job search. You'll notice the other markdown documents here are artifacts for scrum. Because I'm the only person involved, I must fill all three roles, Product Owner, ScrumMaster, and Development Team. And as for rituals, there are records kept of those as well. I am basically trying to see if I can conduct a personal scrum, scale it down to be useful in this circumstance as a very meta exercise of developing myself as a developer. Please feel free to review my progress. 

My day job does not allow me blocks of free time to go to bootcamps or other such programs, nor does it provide the funds to finance such a solution. It is an engineering challenge. How do you build a developer on only after-hours time and effectively zero dollars? So I am engaging scrum as the framework for this. I hope to be able to use the skills I learn in this experiment as a primer for working in larger teams.

As for teams, I work with a meetup here called fullStackLA: https://github.com/fullstackla. And I am also working on a two-person adroid development project: https://gihub.com/dicehard. My theatre background gives me a wealth of soft skills relating to teamwork and communication. What I am learning is how to effectively contribute to such teams and add value to both their workflow and their product.

I hope you will consider me as a member of your team. I am very committed to learning, as my github account will attest. I am currently looking for a place where I can grow as a junior developer or business analyst and contribute to your organization's overall value. If you have any questions I would be thrilled to answer them. If you Have any suggestions, I'd be equally thrilled to hear them. Please e-mail me at ian.d.carroll@gmail.com or just post something in the issues. :smile:

I'm looking forward to hearing from you and would love the opportunity to contribute to your team!

Warm wishes,
Ian

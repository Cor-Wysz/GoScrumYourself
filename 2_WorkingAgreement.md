Working Ageements:

1. Maintain the Scrum artifacts. Keep all the logs tidy. Changes need to be updated immediately.
2. Write a daily scrum entry... daily.
3. Make a contribution to github daily.
4. Spend some part of each day with practice books like "Learn Python the Hard Way"
5. at least %50 of the day's working time needs to be spent on the Sprint Backlog.
6. Sprints will last 1 week.
	- Planning is on Sunday.
	- Review/Retro is on Saturday.

Definition of Done:

1. If code: code runs.
2. Code has documentation that is up-to-date and fun to read.
3. If not code: It's revised, error free, and posted live for all to see.
4. Scrum logs are updated to reflect the change in status.

These definitions will expand in time to be more nuanced, but for now, I want to lower the barriers to acceptance.

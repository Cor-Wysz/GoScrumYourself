Working Ageements:


Values:

1. I am a free agent, and can ethically choose to quit for any reason I feel legitimate.
2. I am solely responsible for the craftsmanship and artistic expression of my product.
3. My values and the values of my client must be in general alignment, othewise I am ethically obligated to speak out, or ultimately quit.
4. I will follow the priorites of my client so long as the above remains true.
5. I reserve the right to reevaluate my ethics if they are challenged by my work.
6. I refuse any label other than 'developer' or 'software crafter' while on a team. Labels cheapen me, and limit my value to the team.
7. I may accept sponsorship of any team or organization I am a pert of, but will refuse ownership by any such organiztion. the team and the client determine priorities. I am solely responsible for the craftsmanship of the product and the ethical ramifications of delivery.
8. I accept and realize the burden of thinking for myself ethically. I accept the burden of doing the work in a craftsmanly manner. No one else can enforce those values on me, and only I can maintain them. This is hard work, and I will carry it without complaint or expectation of relief by anyone other than myself.


Practice:

1. Maintain the Scrum artifacts. Keep all the logs tidy. Changes need to be updated immediately.
2. Write a daily scrum entry... daily.
3. Make a contribution to github daily.
4. Spend some part of each day with practice books like "Learn Python the Hard Way"
5. at least %50 of the day's working time needs to be spent on the Sprint Backlog.
6. Sprints will last 1 week.
	- Planning is on Thursday.
	- Review/Retro is on Wednesday.

Definition of Done:

1. If code: code runs.
2. Code has documentation that is up-to-date and fun to read.
3. code has full test coverage
3. If not code: It's revised, error free, and posted live for all to see.
4. Scrum logs are updated to reflect the change in status.

These definitions will expand in time to be more nuanced, but for now, I want to lower the barriers to acceptance.

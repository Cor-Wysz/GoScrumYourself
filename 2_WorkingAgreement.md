Working Ageements:


Values:

1. I am a free agent, and can ethically choose to quit for any reason I feel legitimate.
2. My values and the values of my client must be in alignment, othewise I am ethically obligated to speak out.
3. I will follow the priorites of my client so long as the above remains true.

4. I accept the burden of and am solely responsible for the ethical ramifications of any product I deliver.
5. I accept the burden of and am solely responsible for the craftsmanship and artistic expression of my product.
6. I accept the burden of and am solely responsible for the development and maintainence of my ethics and craftsmanship.
7. No client or team can accept the burden of the above responsibilities on my behalf.

Practice:

1. Maintain the Scrum artifacts. Keep all the logs tidy. Changes need to be updated immediately.
2. Write a daily scrum entry... daily.
3. Make a contribution to github daily.
4. Spend some part of each day with practice books like "Learn Python the Hard Way"
5. at least %50 of the day's working time needs to be spent on the Sprint Backlog.
6. Sprints will last 1 week.
	- Planning is on Thursday.
	- Review/Retro is on Wednesday.

Definition of Done:

1. If code: code runs.
2. Code has documentation that is up-to-date and fun to read.
3. code has full test coverage
3. If not code: It's revised, error free, and posted live for all to see.
4. Scrum logs are updated to reflect the change in status.

These definitions will expand in time to be more nuanced, but for now, I want to lower the barriers to acceptance.

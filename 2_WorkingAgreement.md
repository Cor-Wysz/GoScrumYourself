Working Agreements:


Goal:

To build value beyond what word, number, or dollar can quantify.
1. To increase Friendship, Wonder, and Joy for one and for all in process and product alike.
2. To develop the courage and endurance to uphold a Code of Responsibility in support of my Goal.
3. To provide useful services and products that express my Goal.

Code of Responsibility:

1. I pledge my work to the needs of of the whole team, all the people my work affects.
2. I reserve the right to leave any team that undermines my pledge.
3. I accept the burden of the ethical ramifications of any product I deliver.
4. I accept the burden of the craftsmanship and artistic expression of my product.
5. I accept the burden of the development and maintainence of my ethics and craftsmanship.
6. I acknowledge that no team, no person or persons, can accept the burden of the above on my behalf.

Practice:

1. Maintain the Scrum artifacts. Keep all the logs tidy. Changes need to be updated immediately.
2. Write a daily scrum entry... daily.
3. Make a contribution to github daily.
4. Spend some part of each day with practice books like "Learn Python the Hard Way"
5. at least %50 of the day's working time needs to be spent on the Sprint Backlog.
6. Sprints will last 1 week.
	- Planning is on Thursday.
	- Review/Retro is on Wednesday.

Definition of Done:

1. If code: code runs.
2. Code has documentation that is up-to-date and fun to read.
3. code has full test coverage
3. If not code: It's revised, error free, and posted live for all to see.
4. Scrum logs are updated to reflect the change in status.

These definitions will expand in time to be more nuanced, but for now, I want to lower the barriers to acceptance.

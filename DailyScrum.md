 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - No blockers besides myself. The biggest blocker is not my job, or my situation. The biggest blocker is me and my emotional health. The more I can stand up and work despite how the world makes me feel, the more work I can do. In classical Chinese culture, there are four plants that represent the virtues of a noble person: Orchid, Bamboo, Chrysanthemum, and Plum. The plum represents courage. At the coldest time of the year, and without any leaves on its branches, it will burst into bloom. It will even bloom though ice and snow coated on its branches. The flowers are small and ususally white, though they can range to pink and deep red. And when they break through the ice, they are often overlooked for their size, especially if they are white. You hardly notice them in the snow. When the plum blooms, it exposes its most delicate side to the worst conditions and yet thrives. In so doing, it breaks the spell of winter and heralds the return of spring. I have to be like this plum blossom. Sorry if that seemed overly sentimental or grandiose, but the story of the plum blossom captivates me. There are no blockers besides my appeasement of ice and snow, and my trepidation to bloom in spite of them.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I don't like having to stand up to bullies, espeically ones that assume only one relationship dynamic, master/slave, (you're the slave) and are immediately angry, hurt, or insulted if you don't follow along with that assuption perfectly. I had a work colleague do this to me today. My bosses told me I don't have to put up with it. I didn't. But It's still quite tiring to have to tell someone "no" who feels they have every right to command you. As such, the adrenaline from the fight is still in my system, and I'll need to calm down, and get less jumppy if I want to do good work today. That'd be my main blocker. Still, I feel good to be able to stand up for myself.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I have noticed that I have done precious little reading of Clean Code, nor have I done much in the way of preparing for my next onsite interview. There are reasons for this. I'm afraid certain activities make me look like "I am coding" while others, regardless of their value, do not. I cannot do much of what doesn't look like coding at the moment as I work with another nearby who I am afraid will criticise me for "not coding". Now that may be irrational and not entirely true, but nonetheless I feel it, so I will have to ramp up the courage to do what I need to... but not today. today I'm chickening out. I think I'll save the bravery for next sprint. It's Christmas, and I should enjoy myself. Save the hard growing opportunity for when I have the stength for it :)

  - Sprint 21 planning
 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Start Forking part of algorithm
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I have to watch out for despair, hopelessness and the abuse heaped on my by someone close to me which causes those feelings. I hope I don't have to continue to work in these conditions for much longer, because I'm starting to unravel. If I can maintain myself a little longer to get this project completed, I'll feel better. I need a chance to rest. All I do is work, and deal with abuse. I am not in an environment where rest is possible. I need to at least complete the project, and do my very best to maintain quality for it. I have to find some way to manufacture hope and joy for myself so that I can fuel my work. Maybe coding is the thing. I do enjoy it a lot. I'll do coding and finish this project well. Abuse by someone close to me is my blocker. I can only remove it by pushing through.

  - Complete the new abstraction and integrate it into the code
  - create a better directory structure so that there's not just a jumble of files in the source directory
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - Time. And there's a danger that in refactoring this code, I'll have to do surgery on evey class method that calls the new function. I'll probably have to refactor the names sooner or later. And I might need to disinherit Announcer from Scriptographer at some point in the future. This gets into a question about which is worse, inheritance, or importing objects. I suppose it depends on how you implement them, but I can't just rely on Zed Shaw for my opinion, as brilliant as he may be.

12/5/16
 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - build a complete test suite for the stage manager and its abstractions

  - reorganize source files to be grouped into folders so that my eyes don't glaze over looking at them.
  - enjoy the craft
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - time. but I should be able to get something done. It's more important to get less done and do it with craftsmanship than it is to get it all done but done poorly. I still have all of tomorrow.

12/4/16
 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Build the replacement abstractions
  - Meditate properly on the task. Enjoy paying attention to the craft. Slow down.
 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - work on building a complete test suite for the new package.
  - if there's any time left over, try integrating and playing the new package.
  - continue to find joy in paying attention to the craft. slow down and do good work.
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - nah. I will probably need to push just about everything else back a sprint. It might be better to focus on getting all the code looking this nice.

12/3/16
 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Continued to build a replacement referee
 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Continue to build the replacement with propper tests and abstractions.
  - Meditate properly on this task. take the appropriate time. Enjoy paying attention to the craft. Slow down.
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__

12/2/16
 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Start on abstracting the many jobs of referee. She does too much.
 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__

  - present what I have to 8th Light
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - time again, but I should have just enough. I will not be able to do a webhook to a Travis CI deplyoment this sprint. Too  much of a yakshave. And not a terrible loss. It was more extra credit. I'll move it to next sprint.

11/29/16
 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - identified places that need test coverage
  - since I would need to redo the test anyway as I got into major refactoring, and since my brain was mush, I had the courage to not code. Instead I went to sleep early.
 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - refactor the code to repeat itself less (pretty epic)
   - refactor move to be mostly an inherited method from Player
   - find a way to have announcer do all the announcing.
   - create general methods in facilitator or beyond, that allows general scanning of the board

   - it's a ton of work, but I should be able to make decent progress.

11/28/16
 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Clean up the tests
 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Cover all the functions with at least 1 test.
   - refactor the code base if necessary to accompish this.
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - Time again. But there is still tomorrow. Tomorrow is the last day before the end of the sprint, but it is also a day off from my day job, so I hope to get a lot done between now and then.

  - Port tests to unittest
  - Start work on the rest of cleaning up the test cases.
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - This is a rather big intimidating undertaking. I hope I can actually achieve it. Any case, I've got a few hours. If it takes longer than that, I'm not throwing good time after bad to make it happen. I'll move on to other tasks.

   - move sleep() to Referee
   - Don't allow illegal Human.move to write to the board.
   - check_conscience() needs to print something.
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - Time, and exhaustion from work. Black Friday today, but I'm finally feeling fresh enough to tackle this with great gusto!

So I need to make sure that's squared away before noon, or I know aythm reasonable workaround. Other than that, I need to keep calm and do my best. I'm prepared.

  - Sickness. I'm still pretty sick and I need to sleep, so I will code some and then get some rest. In the retail world, the idea of not coming to work because you're sick is unheard of. If you don't come in to work while you are sick, you are penalized by not being paid that day, or otherwise from having to take a sick day, which there are not an infinite ammount of, or take a social hit because you're not as dependable as they need. So you go into work sick, everyone else gets sick. They all have to come into work too. I hear software development is not like that. I'll have to remember that when telling developers about being sick. They'll expect me to be sensible in a way I haven't been since my school years.

  - No blockers, other than not knowing what to do with the sprint. A lot of time at conference. Planning and personal life has convinced me that in order to maintain my momentum, I'll need to pair back the commitment to 30 points. I don't know what will happen this week in that regard. The uncertainty alone will create cognitive overhead which will decrease my velocity, so I prepare for a rough one, personally.

  - I'm a little frightened to make this commitment, because I don't know how involved this last project gets. I've heard some crazy scary stories, but I'll commit anyway. I will complete Learn Python the Hard Way TODAY!

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - No, I think I've got this. But I'll have to focus. I did some free code camp, and though it's addictive, I need to hold off on that for now so that I can complete this book in time for the conference.

  - It's risky, but I'm running out of time. My best chance to complete these last three assignments is with decent blocks of time. That can only happen today and tomorrow. After that, Thursday and Friday are lower productivity days, so I can't rely on them.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - No blockers. I worry that a lot of negativity from friends will hurt my velocity, but I feel the task is reasonable, and will still not endager the Sprint Goal. There just won't be a lot of extras like last sprint.

  - I'm feeling a supreme lack of confidence in my ability to figure out this test drive in ex48. I'll need some dedicated time to work on it. So I'll peck at it a little tonight, and really blast away at it Tomorrow morning.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - There will not be much more time considering I have a mid-shift that breaks up my time today, but the only thing that might be droppe was an extra that was added on later anyway. So no big deal if that doesn't get done.

  - I will only have maybe an hour to work this morning. Then I have to go to work. Then I have to try to meet people at the meetup if I can. It'll be a busy day.

 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Complete ex45.py "You Make a Game"
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - There is a high chance I will not be able to complete this, because there's still so much text and description to write. I'll focus on the code first, and meeting the requirements. If I run out of time, I'm moving on. The most important thing is that I code, not write a novel.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I had a weird laziness bout this morning, but I should be fine. In years past, I had a tendency to sleep in as a way of hiding from problems I didn't want to face. The code in ex43 is very different from what I've worked with before, so I fell into the old habit of shying away from it. I have found more of a groove now, though. I just have to be aware that this is a habit of mine, and not let it interfere with my productivity.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I spent a lot of time last night writing a blog post because I got done a little early. This may actually impact my velocity. I'll have to be careful about pushing more work in during a sprint. I'm happy with the post though, but it looks like it's going to cost me.

  - I do have quite a few meetings today, so I'll need to use the morning to be productive. Also the next three days are going to be swamped. I have my Dad flying in to see me Thursday, Friday and Saturday, then my Wife's company barbicue Saturday. Thursday in the morning will be all the time I have. Friday after work when I'm completely exhausted will be my only real chance to code that day. I'll need to get something done Saturday morning before the Barbicue but after Dad has left. This will be a challenge to code all three days.

  - The sprint goal is in danger again. Thursday and Friday are not days I can count on for productivity. I would be able to meet the goal if I didn't end up spending the time talking with my wife. Don't get me wrong, talking with my wife is important, and I value it, but it eats opportunities to apply for jobs and get what needs to be done done. I also cannot communicate that to my wife. I have to be there for her. This will need to be addressed in the retrospective.

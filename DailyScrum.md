2. What will I do today to help the development teaME meet the Sprint Goal?

  - Do an exercise today.
3. Do I see any impediment that prevents the me and/or the development TeaME from meeting the Sprint Goal?
  - because of erratic day-job scheduling, I only have a total of two hours to work today, and already 3/4 of that is used. I will have to work hard to produce little today.

  - No blockers, other than not knowing what to do with the sprint. A lot of time at conference. Planning and personal life has convinced me that in order to maintain my momentum, I'll need to pair back the commitment to 30 points. I don't know what will happen this week in that regard. The uncertainty alone will create cognitive overhead which will decrease my velocity, so I prepare for a rough one, personally.

  - There will not be much more time considering I have a mid-shift that breaks up my time today, but the only thing that might be droppe was an extra that was added on later anyway. So no big deal if that doesn't get done.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - There is a high chance I will not be able to complete this, because there's still so much text and description to write. I'll focus on the code first, and meeting the requirements. If I run out of time, I'm moving on. The most important thing is that I code, not write a novel.

9/19/16
 1. __What did I do Yesterday that helped meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Sprint 8 Planning

 2. __What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal?__
  - Complete ex43 "Basic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design"
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I had a weird laziness bout this morning, but I should be fine. In years past, I had a tendency to sleep in as a way of hiding from problems I didn't want to face. The code in ex43 is very different from what I've worked with before, so I fell into the old habit of shying away from it. I have found more of a groove now, though. I just have to be aware that this is a habit of mine, and not let it interfere with my productivity.

  - Sprint 8 Planning
  - Get started on ex43 "Basic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design"
 3. __Do I see any blockers that prevent me from meeting the Sprint Goal?__
  - I spent a lot of time last night writing a blog post because I got done a little early. This may actually impact my velocity. I'll have to be careful about pushing more work in during a sprint. I'm happy with the post though, but it looks like it's going to cost me.

  - I do have quite a few meetings today, so I'll need to use the morning to be productive. Also the next three days are going to be swamped. I have my Dad flying in to see me Thursday, Friday and Saturday, then my Wife's company barbicue Saturday. Thursday in the morning will be all the time I have. Friday after work when I'm completely exhausted will be my only real chance to code that day. I'll need to get something done Saturday morning before the Barbicue but after Dad has left. This will be a challenge to code all three days.

Not to say they are not valuable learning opportunities, but I need to focus on the tasks I need to accomplish first. Then after they're complete, I can check the social stuff.

  - The sprint goal is in danger again. Thursday and Friday are not days I can count on for productivity. I would be able to meet the goal if I didn't end up spending the time talking with my wife. Don't get me wrong, talking with my wife is important, and I value it, but it eats opportunities to apply for jobs and get what needs to be done done. I also cannot communicate that to my wife. I have to be there for her. This will need to be addressed in the retrospective.

  - Beyond fighting off the years of unoptimized emotional habits, no. But that's quite a job. And I imagine one that's here to stay. Developing new habits is hard for a person. It's got to be even harder for an organization, but it's the same process. Todo: Develop a set of tools to manage and guide my emotional habits toward the more productive and positive.

__Sprint 3 Velocity:__ 40

__Sprint 3 Review:__

This sprint was the fist that I wasn't able to get every last task done. Par of the reason for this was the time spent going to extra meetups which due to my work schedule, I previously couldn't go to. However, those meetups provided me with a great ammount of additional expereince, and networking opportunities. Both of the Job Applications I have made came from meetups. This is significant.

Unlike the expereince of searching online for jobs to apply to, performing the job of being a software developer has lead people I've just met to mention job openings and a desire to hire me. There are still hurdles. The first is I lack the number of years working in a "professional" environment. That will have to be circumvented. I obviouly can't come prepared with such experience in my first job. The second is that I lack hard skills with regards to frameworks and DevOps. And these will be themes to add to the backlog after I have the application process down, and am prepared to give a strong application.

This sprint I met these goals:
  - Exercise 23 of learn python the hard way
  - A definition of done checklist for job applications
  - A revised resume and coverletter strategy
  - A coaching issue tracker for scrumming my current retail job.
  - Applications to two jobs
I also Coached and paired on Ruby and Rust; two languages I am unfamiliar with. I learned about SaltStack, Docker, and deployment at scale. I learned about some of the dangers and chaffing points of a career in development. And I made some friends.

I failed to deliver on one job application, which will have to move to next sprint.

__Sprint 2 Velocity:__ 52

__Sprint 2 Review:__

This sprint more than doubled the velocity of the last, but it took all the time I had. I barely had time to go to meetups, and I had no time at all for my android project, which has been sadly negected for a while now. Next sprint will need to be kept under 50.

I met the goal here:
  - Learn Python the Hard Way Lessons: 5x -3-
  - Apply to Jobs: 3x -5-
  - Blog Post: The Map is not the Territory -5-
  - Blog Post: Won't the Real Scrum Agile Please Stand Up? -5-
  - Revise Resume -5-
  - Revise GitHub Cover Letter -5-
  - Research CC courses -2-
I also did this:
  - Attended a tech-job-getting seminar

Now I have a much better resume, a much better github cover letter, more practice with my application pitch, a better understanding of what recuiters pay attention to, a deeper understanding of languages, and two new blog posts to increase my web footprint. I also learned that PCC's CS courses are all filled up, and to go talk to the professor directly about getting requirements challenged and waived so I can take the classes that I'm clearly ready for. (I had no idea I needed to know pre-calculus to start coding! I ought to tell my dev freinds to stop coding because they don't know high level mathematics :P)

__Sprint 1 Review:__

This sprint was encouraging. As far as first sprints go, which I hear is shakey, this wasn't too bad. I accomplished the entire sprint goal and then some!

I met the goal here:
  - Updated LinkedIn Profile
  - Scouted Jobs on Agile Alliance website ( Which turned into something more useful during the sprint: Applied for jobs!)
  - Polished GitHub code, which I figured would take a lot of time, but in actuality didn't take much.
  - Put up the GoScrumYourself repo and added a Cover Letter as a readme. Pleasantly meta for me.
Partly because of necessity, partly because I had the time:
  - Write a resume.

In the end I have an embarassingly incomplete Minimum Viable Product which I can get feedback and make ajustments as I go. and that's Lean working together with Scrum. If I'm not putting myself out there to get feedback, I'm not really scrumming.
I have a small baseline knowlege of what to expect next sprint. and after two more, I should be able to know exactly where things are going.

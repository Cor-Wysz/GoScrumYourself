__Velocity Change Log:__ +28, 24

__Sprint 2 Velocity:__ 52

This sprint more than doubled the velocity of the last, but it took all the time I had. I barely had time to go to meetups, and I had no time at all for my android project, which has been sadly negected for a while now. Next sprint will need to be kept under 50.

I met the goal here:
  - Learn Python the Hard Way Lessons: 5x -3-
  - Apply to Jobs: 3x -5-
  - Blog Post: The Map is not the Territory -5-
  - Blog Post: Won't the Real Scrum Agile Please Stand Up? -5-
  - Revise Resume -5-
  - Revise GitHub Cover Letter -5-
  - Research CC courses -2-
I also did this:
  - Attended a tech-job-getting seminar

Now I have a much better resume, a much better github cover letter, more practice with my application pitch, a better understanding of what recuiters pay attention to, a deeper understanding of languages, and two new blog posts to increase my web footprint. I also learned that PCC's CS courses are all filled up, and to go talk to the professor directly about getting requirements challenged and waived so I can take the classes that I'm clearly ready for. (I had no idea I needed to know pre-calculus to start coding! I ought to tell my dev freinds to stop coding because they don't know high level mathematics :P)

__Sprint 1 Velocity:__ 24

__Sprint 1 Review:__

This sprint was encouraging. As far as first sprints go, which I hear is shakey, this wasn't too bad. I accomplished the entire sprint goal and then some!

I met the goal here:
  - Updated LinkedIn Profile
  - Scouted Jobs on Agile Alliance website ( Which turned into something more useful during the sprint: Applied for jobs!)
  - Polished GitHub code, which I figured would take a lot of time, but in actuality didn't take much.
  - Put up the GoScrumYourself repo and added a Cover Letter as a readme. Pleasantly meta for me.
Partly because of necessity, partly because I had the time:
  - Write a resume.

In the end I have an embarassingly incomplete Minimum Viable Product which I can get feedback and make ajustments as I go. and that's Lean working together with Scrum. If I'm not putting myself out there to get feedback, I'm not really scrumming.
I have a small baseline knowlege of what to expect next sprint. and after two more, I should be able to know exactly where things are going.

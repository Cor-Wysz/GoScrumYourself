__Sprint 1 Review:__

This sprint was encouraging. As far as first sprints go, which I hear is shakey, this wasn't too bad. I accomplished the entire sprint goal and then some!

I met the goal here:
  - Updated LinkedIn Profile
  - Scouted Jobs on Agile Alliance website ( Which turned into something more useful during the sprint: Applied for jobs!)
  - Polished GitHub code, which I figured would take a lot of time, but in actuality didn't take much.
  - Put up the GoScrumYourself repo and added a Cover Letter as a readme. Pleasantly meta for me.
Partly because of necessity, partly because I had the time:
  - Write a resume.

In the end I have an embarassingly incomplete Minimum Viable Product which I can get feedback and make ajustments as I go. and that's Lean working together with Scrum. If I'm not putting myself out there to get feedback, I'm not really scrumming.
I have a small baseline knowlege of what to expect next sprint. and after two more, I should be able to know exactly where things are going.

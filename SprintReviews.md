__Sprint 14 Velocity:__ 25

__Sprint 14 Review:__

what gets added:

 - 4 more Test-Driven Learn Ruby the Hard Way exercises
 - tests for Twilight Sparkle, plus more sparkles
 - A successful phone screening interview

The successful phone screen was an unqualified success. I feel I have a good way of handling this part of the interview process, and will use this as a model for similar future ones.
 1. Let the interviewer talk. Let them describe in their own words what is important to them.
 2. talk about how you could be helpful to their goals, and what you are looking for in a team.
 3. Let them talk some more. Always listen. Never assume.

In addition, I have switched focus since the technical screen comes next. Supposedly it is simple. All the more reason to be as ready as I can be. So until the interview, Ruby is on hold, Python is what I will be making sure is fresh in my mind for the interview. I need as much quiet and space as I can get to prepare.

__Sprint 13 Velocity:__ 25

__Sprint 13 Review:__

what gets added:

 - Follow-up on SCNA contacts
 - Applied to Apprenticeship

The most important items of follow-up were attended to this sprint at the expense of Learn Ruby the Hard Way. However, I have still learned a lot, and it was all in service to the ultimate goal: get employed in a good team.

Additional merits:

 - Learned Johnny-5 and Arduino with Justin Dorfman
 - Cobbled together a plan of attack on the Downtown Women's Center Data Collection
 - Gained insights into the Software Process (Process first, skills are a byproduct) @ drinks.js
 - Gained insigths into how to run a Swarm, or for that matter a project: (The least experienced person leads) @ drinks.js

__Sprint 12 Velocity:__ 45

__Sprint 12 Review:__

What gets added:

 - A much better understanding of the workflow of TDD
 - An opportunity to pair program and test drive all at once
 - 6 new exercises added to Learn Ruby the Hard Way
 - Valuable leads on Apprenticeships at Pivotal Labs and 8th Light
 - A very good conference expereience
 - Interesting pull requests for FullStackLA
 - Opened a sufficient number of pull requests for Hacktoberfest

This week was productive. I am exhausted, but I will keep going and test-drive my development.

__Sprint 11 Velocity:__ 45

__Sprint 11 Review:__

What gets added:

 - 7 test-driven exercises from Learn Ruby the Hard Way
 - Blog post: How to have an awesome meetup even if the host doesn't show.
 - Contributed to FullStackLA with issue and pull request templates; learned another feature of github
 - Contributed to Hoodie solo for a second time.
 - Successfully facilitated a meetup.
 - Introduced 3 different people to github through pair programming.

At this rate of learning, I can expect to have a good grasp on Ruby by December 17. In the mean time, I need to also work on being social at meetups, contribute whatever I can to open source, work in teams and deliver value. As I ramp up there, I should find the softer skills meeting the hard skills of more formalized learning. But I definitely need to do both.

__Sprint 10 Velocity:__ 39

__Sprint 10 Review:__

What gets added:
 - Make a bunch of friends by pairing and geeking out about Agile at Star West
 - Tweet voraciously about my expereince so that I share wqhat I'm learning to the OSS community
 - Create 3 new repositories for python modules:
  1. twilight.sparkle CLI text color module
  2. simplClock counter module
  3. random GPS module for generating mock data in map websites
 - made my first contribution to a Open Source Project used by more than just me and my friends.

What got dropped:
 Start TDD with Learn Ruby the Hard Way

__Sprint 9 Velocity:__ 41

__Sprint 9 Review:__

What gets added:

 - Learn Python the Hard Way
 - A better understanding of frameworks, tests, and how they work together
 - Improvements to my social netowrking
 - improvements in documentation

I have officially leaned python the hard way. Up next will be a week of conference time, probably it will be spent working on python tdd in classes there, or in contributions to open source. October is Hacktoberfest. Scarry to dare, but this is a useful shove in the right direction. I hope I get a t-shirt!

__Sprint 8 Velocity:__ 44

__Sprint 8 Review:__

What gets added:

 - 5 exercises from Learn Python the Hard Way
 - A better understanding of TDD
 - More experience with OOP
 - A blog post: Scrum at the Book Store
 - A blog post: Scrum explained in 300 seconds or less

This was a very productive week. The first of the two blog posts turned out to be quite popular. I do have to spend more time working on TDD, and how to make it a habit, but in general, the answer seems to be, "just do it and you'll never understand how you did without it." I also learned about standing up to pressures from clients, Knowledge work when you have none, that pair programming needs 2 willing participants to take hold. And that I can talk pretty well. I hope to get the hard skills down more and more, because I feel that once I have those, I have a job. Most everything else is in place.

__Sprint 7 Velocity:__ 33

__Sprint 7 Review:__

What gets added:

 - 6 excercises from Learn Python the Hard Way, up to exercise 42.
 - A better grasp of object orientation and how it fits into the general schema of development
 - A new habit of coding every day.
 - Improved confidence in my ability to not only talk and colaborate about projects, but also get down and do the work solo.

I had a very fruitful meeting with a fellow developer who helped me optimise my workflow and start having me think in more professinal detail regarding the steps of working on team projects with github.

I intended for this time to also be about TDD, but that will need to wait based on how the python book is going. I am confident in my ability to learn TDD and begin applying it as a development technique to my workflow in a natural way, but it will have to wait about 2 or maybe 3 weeks depending on the intensity of the last 10 exercises in Learn Python the Hard Way. In either case, I will be prepared for the upcoming conference. Post conference, I'm thinking that getting through Learn Ruby the Hard Way may be a good thing to try, that way I can have some Ruby for conference 2, which is ruby-centric. This is an option for me. Other options may include setting up TDD as part of my workflow, learning Django, Docker, and possibly integrating more of the SciPy stack into my Python. I'll never know less than I know right now, so I'll make that decision at the last responsible moment.

__Sprint 6 Velocity:__ 32

__Sprint 6 Review:__

What gets added:

 - A better understanding of scrum in the ecosystem of other agile methodologies, especially in reference to XP.
 - A revised blog on OSS scrumming.
 - A better understanding of how to go about learning development and TDD.
 - Learn Python the Hard way to exercise 36.

I also had some very useful talks with developers and aquired feedback on directions to take from where I am. I need solid programming time. The devs I know are doubtful that I can pass a techinical interview. This is actually very good news, it neamns that they think i've gotten good enough to trick a company into embarassing myself by even giving me a technical interview. So solid! That's a new error message and it's fantastic. Future sprints are going to focus on preparing for the upcoming conferences in october, learning Python, TDD, and JS. Coding every day to be able to pass a technical interview, and really solve problems every day.

A few things got dropped because reading "Learning Agile" took up about 8 points which I didn't include in the sprint planning. It looks like 30 points is a stable ammount for me to be using for my estimates. Learn Python the Hard Way will be the primary focus for the next 3 sprints.


__Sprint 5 Velocity:__ 32

__Sprint 5 Review:__

What gets added:
 
 - Resume restyling and refactoring overhaul to make my resume much more artistically expressive and engaging.
 - Seprerate resumes for Dev vs ScrumMaster roles
 - Identified knowlege gaps to pull together a list of skills to become proficient in.
 - Learn Python the Hard Way exercises. 
 - Blog post: Scrum for OSS contributors. - A useful resource for github contributors pairing on fsla website

I also worked on identifying user stories, and generating a backlog. I discovered the use of github milestones. I updated the docs to fix typos, and added needed links and features to the README.md. I also helped consult on two other projects thinking of ways to adopt Agile practices, and continued baby steps of introducing scrum to Barnes and Noble.


__Sprint 4 Velocity:__ 34

__Sprint 4 Review:__

What gets added:

  - Job Application Tracker: Now I'll be able to follow up and record feedback so I can make changes to my plan based on what is expected.
  - Blog post: Pairing into the Unkown with Rust. Describing how far you can get in a state of total ignorance. Learning to surf that wave without trpidation.
  - Revised Application Definition of Done Checklist: The checklist includes questions about whether I have demonstrated 
   1. An Ability to Think
   2. An ability to Learn
   3. An ability to Produce
  - 3 Learn Python the Hard Way exercises.

I also pair programmed and generally contributed useful things at FullStackLA, went to a new meetup to see what I could see, had a long meeting with Drew Adams about the vast field of the technology profession. A lot of extras happened that are going to influence my development.

__Sprint 3 Velocity:__ 40

__Sprint 3 Review:__

This sprint was the fist that I wasn't able to get every last task done. Par of the reason for this was the time spent going to extra meetups which due to my work schedule, I previously couldn't go to. However, those meetups provided me with a great ammount of additional expereince, and networking opportunities. Both of the Job Applications I have made came from meetups. This is significant.

Unlike the expereince of searching online for jobs to apply to, performing the job of being a software developer has lead people I've just met to mention job openings and a desire to hire me. There are still hurdles. The first is I lack the number of years working in a "professional" environment. That will have to be circumvented. I obviouly can't come prepared with such experience in my first job. The second is that I lack hard skills with regards to frameworks and DevOps. And these will be themes to add to the backlog after I have the application process down, and am prepared to give a strong application.

This sprint I met these goals:
  - Exercise 23 of learn python the hard way
  - A definition of done checklist for job applications
  - A revised resume and coverletter strategy
  - A coaching issue tracker for scrumming my current retail job.
  - Applications to two jobs
I also Coached and paired on Ruby and Rust; two languages I am unfamiliar with. I learned about SaltStack, Docker, and deployment at scale. I learned about some of the dangers and chaffing points of a career in development. And I made some friends.

I failed to deliver on one job application, which will have to move to next sprint.

__Sprint 2 Velocity:__ 52

__Sprint 2 Review:__

This sprint more than doubled the velocity of the last, but it took all the time I had. I barely had time to go to meetups, and I had no time at all for my android project, which has been sadly negected for a while now. Next sprint will need to be kept under 50.

I met the goal here:
  - Learn Python the Hard Way Lessons: 5x -3-
  - Apply to Jobs: 3x -5-
  - Blog Post: The Map is not the Territory -5-
  - Blog Post: Won't the Real Scrum Agile Please Stand Up? -5-
  - Revise Resume -5-
  - Revise GitHub Cover Letter -5-
  - Research CC courses -2-
I also did this:
  - Attended a tech-job-getting seminar

Now I have a much better resume, a much better github cover letter, more practice with my application pitch, a better understanding of what recuiters pay attention to, a deeper understanding of languages, and two new blog posts to increase my web footprint. I also learned that PCC's CS courses are all filled up, and to go talk to the professor directly about getting requirements challenged and waived so I can take the classes that I'm clearly ready for. (I had no idea I needed to know pre-calculus to start coding! I ought to tell my dev freinds to stop coding because they don't know high level mathematics :P)

__Sprint 1 Velocity:__ 24

__Sprint 1 Review:__

This sprint was encouraging. As far as first sprints go, which I hear is shakey, this wasn't too bad. I accomplished the entire sprint goal and then some!

I met the goal here:
  - Updated LinkedIn Profile
  - Scouted Jobs on Agile Alliance website ( Which turned into something more useful during the sprint: Applied for jobs!)
  - Polished GitHub code, which I figured would take a lot of time, but in actuality didn't take much.
  - Put up the GoScrumYourself repo and added a Cover Letter as a readme. Pleasantly meta for me.
Partly because of necessity, partly because I had the time:
  - Write a resume.

In the end I have an embarassingly incomplete Minimum Viable Product which I can get feedback and make ajustments as I go. and that's Lean working together with Scrum. If I'm not putting myself out there to get feedback, I'm not really scrumming.
I have a small baseline knowlege of what to expect next sprint. and after two more, I should be able to know exactly where things are going.

Sprint Goal

 - Make a habit of gaining appropriate self-confidence. 

 Lack of confidence has caused a lot of problems in my life up until now, and it needs to stop. Fear of failure is another name for the same thing. It causes me to shrink from challenges, let myself off the hook, or not even try. I might have claimed that "No one fun to play with" was the cause of theatre not working out for me, or no money in it, for that matter. But part of the issue was my own lack of self-confidence. It has dammaged my relationships, caused me to be an excessive people pleaser, to not stand up on my own, and to need the approval of others (which, because I don't have approval from myself, is never enough). It has made me exceptionally strong in customer service and sales, but has also turned me into someone who is in his own way, manipulative. Admitting that is shaming, but I need to reframe that to simply be fact and guilt. I have lived in a bad way. I am not a bad person. And I will change. 

I need to guard my self-confidence jealously. In pairing this surfaces as me leaning towards being a professional navigator. Why? Just as the book says. Lack of self-confidence. too much of a lack of self-confidence and I can seriously dammage my professional life. So I need to take care of this. Also I need to take care of this for my own personal wellbeing. I can't code or work in a team if I am this afraid. It needs to stop. I need self-confidence.

In pairing, I need to drive. I need to not be so afraid. I may be a very good teacher, but I've gained just enough skills to hide from working on real challenges by teaching the few things I know. In order to move forward, I need to stop teaching for a while, and start driving.

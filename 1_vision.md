__Product Vision:__

A skilled craftsperson ready to collaborate, contribute and add value to a team working in an agile development environment.

I am the product. This is a little meta, but a good exercise in understanding scrum and agile methodologies.

__Product Roadmap:__

1. __Ready to Apply.__ Be prepeared to accept a position. This is my Minimum Viable Product. If I can't accept a position, and people don't know that I'm looking for one, It doesn't matter what my skills are. I will have missed an opportunity.

2. __Developing Problem-solving skills.__ Develop the human skills of problem solving. The world of software development is big. Really big. There is no possible way to memorize everything. Better to start developing strategies that allow me to face the unknown without trepidation. I should be able to stare down an error message and read it without freaking out or haveing my eyes glaze over.. Know how to google. How to use stackoverflow, and how to research the specific gap in your knowlege.

3. __Eliminating Knowlege Gaps.__ The software world is big, but I should have a foundation. The reason this is not second is because It's more important to know how to solve unknown problems than to have a thorough command of software fundamentals. The ammount of knowlede you really need as you encounter problems is less than what a textbook would have you believe. "30-60% of software features are rarely or never used." And the same is true of software knowlege. So That's why it's better to learn how to face the unknown first. In software development, you're likely doing something that hasn't been done before. So a solid foundation is nice to have, but not as important as knowing how to handle the unknown.

4. __Expanding Domains.__ With an understanding of how to encounter the unknown, and a foundation of basics, I can explore with the assurance that I both can handle the new, and be able to relate it to my current understanding. Learning new languages and frameworks, or programming paradigms happens here. At this point I'm savvy enough to take part in the conversation at the frontiers of software.

5. __Making Smaller Circles.__ While expanding knowlege is good, finding more efficient ways to do what I alreaay know well can have significant effects on my contributions. Making smaller circles is a phrase from Tai Chi. It means becoming more efficient, needing less time to do the same thing, and ultimately, making all processes invisible and effortless. This Needs to happen concurrently with learning new paradigms. A framework is only as good as the practitioner is familiar with it. A thorough knowlege of an older system can produce greater optimizations than a newer system that is not as well known.

I encourage feedback from anyone looking at this, though as Product Owner, I retain the right to make the final call. :)

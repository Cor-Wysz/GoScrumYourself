Retrospectives:


__Sprint 4 - 8/28/16 - 9/3/16__

The sprint was more Manageable. There are two things that happened that I should have been aware of:
 1. I wanted to get more things in than 25 points would allow, so I arteficially deflated the value of several tasks to fit. It was still a lot of work, so by the end of the sprint I had to increase their value, along with the value of a particularly large blog post. Idea structures held holographically in the mind can be glanced in a second, but writing those out in one dimension, or having another read the concepts that make up that structure *takes time* You can't judge how big an idea is based on whenter or not you can hold the whole thought in your head or not. You can hold thoughts of both simplicity and vast complexity there and they feel the same. Find another way to evaluate the magnitude of a task like that.
 2. I do a lot of things that are related to the sprint tangentially, but are not recorded in the sprint. These things take up time, and should be added to the sprint, even though they are disruptive. It will give me a clearer picture of my velocity when I add in these stories-of-opportunity, and help me make better choices about what I have to drop when I accept them.

Actions:
1. Commitment to 30
2. Be careful in evaluating doccumentation and explaination tasks. You can bring up the info in a second, but relaying that info takes time.
3. Add in stories-of-opportunity even though the practice is a little heinous to sprints. Be honest with yourself about this so that you can evaluate their effects and make more well-informed choices.

__Sprint 4 - 8/15/16 - 8/27/16__

This sprint dropped another story. So We're dropping the velocity again to an ammount I can handle. This is hard to do. I feel like I'm failing. But truthfully, I'm just facing known fact and planning with that limitation in mind. The reason for the dropped story was very similar to last sprint. Thursday evening and Friday are not reliably productive days. I do need to take care of my wife during that time, and the loss of that corner of the time box meant I could not fit the last day's work into it effectively.

Actions:
1. Commitment to 25
2. For now, understand Wednesday is your last day for full scale productivity. Thursday/Friday can only contribute minimally.
3. Explain scrum piece by piece to my wife so that she can help me get a job more quickly rather than cause a slow-down.

__Sprint 3 - 8/14/16 - 8/20/16__

This sprint went well, but even with the decrease in velocity, I am still coming up short. And frankly, shorter than when my velocity was at 50+. This is the first sprint where I missed part of the delivery commitment. This is becoming a trend. I'll have to watch this.

In the mean time, the first solution is to decrease the velocity again. If another decrease in velocity is needed next week, I will look into what obstacles are keeping me from moving forward and see about removing those.

taking care of myself was a good move. It's better to do that than to try to hide problems. I'll track more carefully what consistently blocks me from higher velocity next sprint.

Actions:
1. commitment to 35
2. watch for patterns of things that block my progress.

__Sprint 2 - 8/7/16 - 8/13/16__

This sprint was intense, but I still did it. Needless to say, It was close to the edge, and it dodn't feel as great as when I completed sprint 1 even though I got more than twice done. I'm over-exerting myself.

Any negative feeling have an immediate affect on my concentration and velocity. I need to be happy to be productive. I need to be feeling good to think clearly. Certain aspects of my environment cannot be changed, and attention is going to be drawn from the project to combat them. This means I can't expect there to be no rainy days. Factor them in. And as much as possible proactively mitigate them.

Mid-day chores like going to a doctor's appointment mean any time after that even is essentially wasted for the sprint. remember that chores take time. Account for that, or do them early and often beofre the y become big enough to derail your workflow.

Doing smaller stories when time is low is fine, but it's also ok to break a story into smaller tasks so you can start on the mission critical stuff first.

Actions:
1. Pair the commitment down to 40
2. Maintain my mood by treating myself well
3. Do chores early and often.
4. Break stories into requirements when time is low

__Sprint 1 - 7/31/16 - 8/6/13__

I seem to think that "Do a problem from Learn Python the Hard Way" or "Apply for a job" is an activity that takes 0 time. That just ain't so. I'm going to have to get used to the idea that nothing takes 0 time.

All things considered, this went pretty well. I certainly hope I've created a pace I can keep up. That's going to be very important for the future.

I also am going to have to remember to try to take very small bites for working days, especially days where my work schedule cuts my time into 2 tiny 1-2 hour blocks on either end. I'll need to remember to pace myself, and also be careful that I do not waste the precious little time I have.

Actions:
1. Take into account that all things take time.
2. Remember your time is precious. don't waste it frivolously. Every minute counts.
3. Tread lightly but surely and you can keep the pace forever.

Retrospectives:


__Sprint 12 - 10/16/16 - 10/22/16__

This sprint has been exhausting but productive. I am coming hard upon the limits that my feeble human mind can take, so I should remember what this feels like. Pushing past this point is not something that will be sustinably productive. I made some great progress. I also was able to maintain my self-confidence and create a workable level of ego. It's okay to be scared, but I will need to push past that and make sure to do more coding. I need to drive in pairs. I need to assert myself to contribute. so I must continue to maintain, build and defend a healthy sense of self-worth. It is a neccessary investment in my future. I know this ego is not myself, but I need an ego to engage the universe.

Actions:
 1. Continue to not tiptoe around. Do things boldly and with self-possesiveness.
 2. Keep buiding an emotional savings account that will allow me to be bold and helpful.
 3. Drive in pair programming. Talk. But make sure to code as much as you talk (which is a lot).

__Sprint 11 - 10/9/16 - 10/15/16__

The sprint was more productive than expected, which is again encouraging. I have found that it's best to consistently give myself the slightly easier goal of 30 points and getting to around 40 by the end of the sprint rather than setting the goal at 40 and struggling to meet it. For whatever reason, 30 points is a significant number, but allows some slack to add on unpredictable extras without stress, and also gives me a sense of accomplishment when I consistently blow it out of the water.

I have discovered also that my emotional state doesn't have too great an impact on my velocity. I can work even if I'm completely miserable. I have to work harder, but it doesn't seem to impact the velocity that much. 10 to 25% at most. I will say instead that my emotional state, sense of confidence and self-worth are desirable in and of themselves. I don't plan to live without them. They are still not just nice-to-haves. I can carry on through dark times, but those dark times can't last forever. I will eventually cave in. And that's the real danger of not maintaining my spirits, not the current velocity.

Actions:
 1. Don't tiptoe around. Do what I will do. Acknowledge shortcomings, work to improve, but make no applolgies.
 2. Maintain and defend a cheerful spirit. Don't let circumstances rob you of it.

__Sprint 10 - 10/2/16 - 10/8/16__

There were major disruption to what is normal during this sprint: There was a 5 day conference, so most of the time was geared toward socializing and making friends (some call this networking, but I call it making friends). The other major incident was that my computer was damaged by someone I trust. This has made me take some serious time off of the project to stop that from happening again.

actions:
 1. If there is any more violence, to defend my safety and the velocity of the project, I have to leave.
 2. Make sure to be vulnerable and let my trusted parter know how deeply I am sorry for their pain, and my part in producing it. The hope here is that by doing this, I can start to repair the damage.
 3. It is my impression that both of these points have been communicated. I need to take care of my personal relationships so that they don't become blockers to my progress, and also just because it's the right thing to do.

__Sprint 9 - 9/25/16 - 10/1/16__

It was a very productive sprint. There was a major concern that a resurgeance in empotional and domestic upheaval would wreck the velocity and cause Learn Python the Hard Way to come in too late for the conference, but everything got done. Moreover, the extra time was useful for cleaning up some pesky chores and technical debt. Still, I did take a hit because of that. It has been two sprints of peace before this one, and now I can see it does have an impact. I can expect to loose at least 3 points when they happen.

Actions: It can be like walking on egg shells, but you have to manage your mood and the moods of those around you. Them getting you down will add months at least to the end-goal of becoming a competent and employed developer. Trouble is, I have no precise way to go about accomplishing this. I'll just have to try to be useful and competent and hoe that mitigates things.

__Sprint 8 - 9/18/16 - 9/24/16__

This sprint saw a ramping in productivity. I got much more done than anticipated. This is primarily due to a lack of blockers and a focus on uninterrupted productive time during my most productive days: Monday through Wednesday. I have one more week to complete Learn Python the Hard Way before the conference. Then I'll be prepared, and hopefully will be able to make the call about whether to continue with Python there, or pivot to Ruby in preparation for the conference after that.

Actions: Keep going.

__Sprint 7 - 9/11/16 - 9/17/16__

This sprint went well. The goal this week was pretty straight-forward. No task switching. Just work on the workbook, and code every day. It went extrememly well, as this is one of the first sprints in a long time where everything that was supposed to get done got done. Not only that, but all was accomplished with a visit from my parents and a company barbique for my wife's company. So I did not have full hours to work. Most of the tasks were completed by Wednesday, which is what I will aim for in the future as clearly that pattern is a successful one. My opportunity for productivity is front-loaded on the week. 80% of what I do is accomplished before Thursday. Also, 30 - 35 points is becoming a very stable velocity, which I can track and make estimates based on.

One of the major benefits to working this way is that I know how valuable my time is, and what I can realistically accomplish when I use that time for developing myself. I know myself in a way I never thought I could thanks to scrum. Before time was just infinite, I had "all the time in the world". and if I did not, I panicked and hid from whatever thing dared to demand completion within a limit. I also used to think very big ideas, and unrealistically would try to cram them into an impossibly narrow time window for completion. Just because I could envision the end product all-at-once did not mean that I could accomplish it all-at-once too. This was a massive stressor in learning to be a developer. Now, however, I can realistically plot my course and not stess because I know much better how long things take, and where I am on that journey. I also know that just because It can't be done in the time it takes to snap my fingers, no matter how hard I might try to make that happen, it doesn't mean it can't be done. I have realistic confidence, awareness and time management skills from using scrum. and they're still developing. So this is very exciting for me.

Actions: Keep going.

__Sprint 6 - 9/4/16 - 9/10/16__

The sprint took into account the book, and properly guaged, it turns out to be pretty much right on. So I can say that my average velocity is somewhere around 30. If I try to do less, I'll do more. If I try to do more, I'll do less. This gives me a good estimate for longer term planning. There are 16 exercises left in Learn Python the Hard way. However, they show an alarming tendency to increase in time-dificulty as I proceed. we'll have to see, but I might be able to fnish the book before the conference If I make it a priority.

Emotional problems are becoming less constant, and more manageable when they do happen. Now that I have to courage to acknowlege they exist, I'm actually starting to understand how to cope. How to have compassion on myself, yet still focus on getting things done. Basically, how to manage myself sustainably, which is a remarkable thing.

This is the first week with no new notes, just keep doing it, and keep doing the actions that corrected your behavior enough to bring you here.


__Sprint 5 - 8/28/16 - 9/3/16__

The sprint was more Manageable. There are two things that happened that I should have been aware of:
 1. I wanted to get more things in than 25 points would allow, so I arteficially deflated the value of several tasks to fit. It was still a lot of work, so by the end of the sprint I had to increase their value, along with the value of a particularly large blog post. Idea structures held holographically in the mind can be glanced in a second, but writing those out in one dimension, or having another read the concepts that make up that structure *takes time* You can't judge how big an idea is based on whenter or not you can hold the whole thought in your head or not. You can hold thoughts of both simplicity and vast complexity there and they feel the same. Find another way to evaluate the magnitude of a task like that.
 2. I do a lot of things that are related to the sprint tangentially, but are not recorded in the sprint. These things take up time, and should be added to the sprint, even though they are disruptive. It will give me a clearer picture of my velocity when I add in these stories-of-opportunity, and help me make better choices about what I have to drop when I accept them.

Actions:
1. Commitment to 30
2. Be careful in evaluating doccumentation and explaination tasks. You can bring up the info in a second, but relaying that info takes time.
3. Add in stories-of-opportunity even though the practice is a little heinous to sprints. Be honest with yourself about this so that you can evaluate their effects and make more well-informed choices.

__Sprint 4 - 8/15/16 - 8/27/16__

This sprint dropped another story. So We're dropping the velocity again to an ammount I can handle. This is hard to do. I feel like I'm failing. But truthfully, I'm just facing known fact and planning with that limitation in mind. The reason for the dropped story was very similar to last sprint. Thursday evening and Friday are not reliably productive days. I do need to take care of my wife during that time, and the loss of that corner of the time box meant I could not fit the last day's work into it effectively.

Actions:
1. Commitment to 25
2. For now, understand Wednesday is your last day for full scale productivity. Thursday/Friday can only contribute minimally.
3. Explain scrum piece by piece to my wife so that she can help me get a job more quickly rather than cause a slow-down.

__Sprint 3 - 8/14/16 - 8/20/16__

This sprint went well, but even with the decrease in velocity, I am still coming up short. And frankly, shorter than when my velocity was at 50+. This is the first sprint where I missed part of the delivery commitment. This is becoming a trend. I'll have to watch this.

In the mean time, the first solution is to decrease the velocity again. If another decrease in velocity is needed next week, I will look into what obstacles are keeping me from moving forward and see about removing those.

taking care of myself was a good move. It's better to do that than to try to hide problems. I'll track more carefully what consistently blocks me from higher velocity next sprint.

Actions:
1. commitment to 35
2. watch for patterns of things that block my progress.

__Sprint 2 - 8/7/16 - 8/13/16__

This sprint was intense, but I still did it. Needless to say, It was close to the edge, and it dodn't feel as great as when I completed sprint 1 even though I got more than twice done. I'm over-exerting myself.

Any negative feeling have an immediate affect on my concentration and velocity. I need to be happy to be productive. I need to be feeling good to think clearly. Certain aspects of my environment cannot be changed, and attention is going to be drawn from the project to combat them. This means I can't expect there to be no rainy days. Factor them in. And as much as possible proactively mitigate them.

Mid-day chores like going to a doctor's appointment mean any time after that even is essentially wasted for the sprint. remember that chores take time. Account for that, or do them early and often beofre the y become big enough to derail your workflow.

Doing smaller stories when time is low is fine, but it's also ok to break a story into smaller tasks so you can start on the mission critical stuff first.

Actions:
1. Pair the commitment down to 40
2. Maintain my mood by treating myself well
3. Do chores early and often.
4. Break stories into requirements when time is low

__Sprint 1 - 7/31/16 - 8/6/13__

I seem to think that "Do a problem from Learn Python the Hard Way" or "Apply for a job" is an activity that takes 0 time. That just ain't so. I'm going to have to get used to the idea that nothing takes 0 time.

All things considered, this went pretty well. I certainly hope I've created a pace I can keep up. That's going to be very important for the future.

I also am going to have to remember to try to take very small bites for working days, especially days where my work schedule cuts my time into 2 tiny 1-2 hour blocks on either end. I'll need to remember to pace myself, and also be careful that I do not waste the precious little time I have.

Actions:
1. Take into account that all things take time.
2. Remember your time is precious. don't waste it frivolously. Every minute counts.
3. Tread lightly but surely and you can keep the pace forever.

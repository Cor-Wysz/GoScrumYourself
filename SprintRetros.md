Retrospectives:

Sprint 1 - 7/31/16 - 8/6/13

I seem to think that "Do a problem from Learn Python the Hard Way" or "Apply for a job" is an activity that takes 0 time. That just ain't so. I'm going to have to get used to the idea that nothing takes 0 time.

All things considered, this went pretty well. I certainly hope I've created a pace I can keep up. That's going to be very important for the future.

I also am going to have to remember to try to take very small bites for working days, especially days where my work schedule cuts my time into 2 tiny 1-2 hour blocks on either end. I'll need to remember to pace myself, and also be careful that I do not waste the precious little time I have.

Actions:
1. Take into account that all things take time.
2. Remember your time is precious. don't waste it frivolously. Every minute counts.
3. Tread lightly but surely and you can keep the pace forever.:
